# Deprecated

this is my old blog site...new one is at [blog.coldflake.com](https://github.com/marcmo/blog.coldflake.com)

## Blog Website generated with [hakyll]

This Blog used to be hosted at tumblr and now is built using [hakyll].

### Building the Site

There is a rakefile included that has a task (`rake preview`) to preview the site on hakyll's build in preview webserver. This task will take care of compiling everything.

### Prerequisites

A recent and full installation of hakyll. If syntax should be highlighted it's also necessary to have a suitable installation of pandoc:

    cabal install --reinstall -fhighlighting pandoc

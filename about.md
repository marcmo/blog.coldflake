<h1>about</h1>

This site has been made using the following tools/technologies:

* haskell and the awesome [hakyll] framework[^1]
* markdown and [pandoc] for rendering the html
* ruby for all scripting done during website creation
* vim for editing my posts
* [sass] -- css with superpowers
* git for version controll and deployment
* linode for hosting the site
* nginx for serving the static content

Full source code is available [on github].

All images that are used are either my own or care has been taken to ensure proper handling of
rights. Some shots and graphics I bought on [iStockphoto] but most are released under a permissive
licence like the [creativecommons]. But regardless of where I got the material from, I always try to
give proper credit to the original author.

<h1>$title$</h1>

This site has been generated using the [hakyll], a wonderful Haskell library for generating static sites. Full source code is available [on github].

All images that are used are either my own or care has been taken to ensure proper handling of rights. Some shots and graphics I bought on [iStockphoto] but most are released under a permissive licence like the [creativecommons]. But regardless of where I got the material from, I always try to give proper credit to the original author.

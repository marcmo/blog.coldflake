<h1>About</h1>

I'm a software devoloper and co-founder of a Munich based [startup]. During the day I mostly use C++
and Ruby. After work it's mainly haskell ;)

This site has been made using the following tools/technologies:

* haskell and the awesome [hakyll] framework[^1]
* markdown and [pandoc] for rendering the html
* Ruby for all scripting done during website creation
* vim for editing my posts
* [sass] -- css with superpowers
* git for version controll and deployment
* linode for hosting the site
* nginx for serving the static content

All images that are used are either my own or care has been taken to ensure proper handling of
rights. Some shots and graphics I bought on [iStockphoto] but most are released under a permissive
licence like the [creativecommons]. But regardless of where I got the material from, I always try to
give proper credit to the original author.

Full source code is available [on github].
